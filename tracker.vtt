This video is very important to me and it s not only
sands and a trip full of uphill and downhill
as perceived now

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.000
You dont have a clue, but all these area
covers wonderful beaches, lakes with sweet water and is part of an outstanding 
land called Jericoacoara with one of the most beautiful sunrise of the world!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:25.000
Jeri, as usually called by native and tourists,
in the past was a village of fishers and belongs to Jijoca's city.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Long, long years since then, now is a place
visited by artists like Rick Martin and has a structure of restaurantes with
different tastes: italian food, chinese food and local ones. With sun all year, 
winds blowing everywhere, music all around...

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.000
This place is located in Ceara, one of the 27 states
of Brazil, distant 350 km far from Fortaleza, google for Jeri
and you'll understand!

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
This is the place I visit in my honey moon
This is the place I enjoy been with my love.

7
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000
Literally love is all around. You dont have hotels but inns

8
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.900
Here we were comming back to Fortaleza passing trought the sands, 
because there's no asphalt to "civilization" and this was
recorded in september, 2012!
